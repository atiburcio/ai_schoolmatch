# web-research

## Overview

This skill provides instructions for conducting web research on higher-education institutions. Use it to gather recent, relevant facts for school matching and due diligence.

## Instructions

### 1. Understand the Query

Identify the school name, specific topics of interest (e.g., rankings, programs, admissions, tuition, campus life), and any constraints from the user's query.

### 2. Search for Information

Use the web_search tool to find recent, authoritative information. Prioritize:

- Official school websites and press releases
- U.S. News, Niche, College Board, and other ranking/review sites
- Recent news articles about the institution
- Department of Education and IPEDS data sources

### 3. Synthesize Results

- Present findings as concise bullet points
- Group information by topic (e.g., academics, cost, student life)
- Include source URLs for each claim
- Flag any conflicting information across sources

### 4. Quality Standards

- Only include facts from the last 2 years unless historical context is relevant
- Clearly distinguish between verified statistics and anecdotal information
- Note if key information could not be found
